        "question": "Why is Member Count not responding?",
        "answer": "Please check the following before asking for help.<ul><li>Make sure the bot has <code>Read Messages</code>, <code>Send Messages</code>, and <code>Embed Links</code> permissions.</li><li>Make sure the bot is online.

    },
    {
        "question": "Can I change the prefix?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can. Use the command <code>m!prefix &lt;new prefix&gt;</code>. You can also mention the bot with the command. So if you forgot the prefix, you can do <code>Member Count#7205 prefix</code>."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I turn off a counter?",
        "answer": "Run <code>m!counter &lt;counter&gt; &lt;on/off&gt;</code>. For the counter, choose from the following:<br><pre><code>- members (users + bots)<br>- users (humans)<br>- bots (bots)<br>- roles (total roles)<br>- channels (total channels)</code></pre><br>Premium counters:<pre><code>- role (members in a role)<br>- online (online members)<br>- offline (offline members)</code></pre><br>As for the role option, the usage is slightly different: <code>m!counter role &lt;add/remove&gt; &lt;role&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;role&gt;</code> can either be a mention or the name of the role (case sensitive)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I change the counter names?",
        "answer": "Use the command <code>m!countername &lt;counter&gt; &lt;name&gt;</code>, and include <code>{count}</code> in the name where you want the number to be at. This feature is for Patrons only. You can donate at <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/member_count\">https://www.patreon.com/member_count</a>."

    {
        "question": "What are the permissions the bot needs for all commands to work?",
        "answer": "Here's the list:<pre><code>Read Message<br>Send Messages<br>Manage Channels<br>Manage Roles<br>Attach Files<br>Connect<br>Embed Links</code></pre>"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the bot display a count other than these options? (e.g. YouTube subscription)",
        "answer": "As of now, those are the only counters available. If you have any suggestions, do tell us in <a href=\"https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw\">#suggestions</a>!"
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I prevent normal users from using the commands?",
        "answer": "All counter related commands are already restricted to users with the <code>Administrator</code> permission. To prevent usage of other commands, restrict the bot under channel settings: <code>Permissions</code> &gt; <code>Add Member</code> &gt; <code>Member Count</code> &gt; <code>Select â•³ under Send Messages</code>. Note that this will prevent you from being able to use the bot in that channel as well."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I manually update the counters?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can. Simply run <code>m!counter update</code>."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why are the counters duplicating/not updating?",
        "answer": "Please ensure that the bot has the correct permissions to the counters (i.e. <code>See Voice Channel</code>, <code>Manage Channel</code> and <code>Connect</code>)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I change the bot's username and avatar?",
        "answer": "No, username and avatar are global. Changing it will affect all servers Member Count is on. You can only change the bot's nickname under <code>Manage User</code>, if you have the <code>Manage Nicknames</code> permission."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I self-host the bot?",
        "answer": "No, you can't. The bot's code is closed source."
